## Intro
### Why OO design?
- shared vocabulary
- closer to the client domain
- raise the level of abstraction
- reuse (as is, extended; e.g. inheritance)
- modularity (decompose the problem into classes)
- information hiding, encapsulated design
- polymorphism

### Terminology
- **virtual**, **pure virtual**, vtables
- **base**, **super class**, **subclass**, abstract base class
- object slicing
- static data and methods

### ADTs
- Safety: Restrict values to desired range
  - operations leave data in valid state
  - Want "tool-supported" safety, checked via compiler
- Evolvability: Since client code only depends on interface, implementation can change without impacting client
- Cohesion: Keep related things together
- Coupling: degree of dependance
- Productivity: Checks data types for us, but only where required
  - Constructors, mutability operators

Entity
- Copying is not meaningful:
  - prohibit copy constructor
  - prohibit assignment
  - prohibit type conversions
  - avoid equality
  - clone may be useful
- Typically passed around by reference or pointer

Value
- Equality is important
- Consider overloading arithmetic operators
- Virtual functions/inheritance uncommon
